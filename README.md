# Flight Finder App

## Overview
This is a responsive application that allows users to search for flights. It is built with React and retrieves data from the Flights Search API.

Users select their destination and arrival airports from a drop-down list, and the search results will display a table with the following flight details:
  * From
  * To
  * Flight Number
  * Departs
  * Arrives
  * Main Cabin Price
  * First Class Price

The columns for flight information can be sorted by ascending and descending order.
